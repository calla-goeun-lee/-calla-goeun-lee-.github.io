      <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3 style="color:black;">Hello, my name is Calla Goeun Lee. I'm a junior at Allen high school and am very excited to plunge into the field of computer science. From a young age, I was highly influenced by my dad who is software engineer. This triggered my interest in computer science, thus now I'm taking an advanced computer science course at school. Also, I am engaged in a cyber security club and a coding club(Girls who Code).</h3>

    <h3 style="color:black;"> More about my background, I was born and raised in Suwon, South Korea. It is a small city below Seoul and is famous for technology(Samsung's  main headquarter is located at Suwon)and the Hwaseong Fortress which is one of the UNESCO Heritage Sites. I lived in Suwon for 18 years and moved to Mckinney, Texas in May 2022. Since I was raised in Korea, I can fluently speak Korean, English and also Japanese!</h3>

    <h3 style="color:black;">I like taking walks in nature, driving while listening to my favorite playlist, drinking coffee, watching cute animal videos, journaling and more. I also love my sister and my family too! :)</h3>

    <h2>Why Is My Digital Portfolio Important To Me?</h2>
    <h3 style="color:black;">This Digital Portfolio is important to me because it would work as a main hub to all the things I've worked throughout the whole school year. You can already check my digital journals if you click on the "Advance Computer Science 1" link!</h3>
    <h3 style="color:black;">Also, one of the merits of having a "digital portfolio" is that people can take a look at my portfolio regardless of place and time. So, I hope my future employers get to see what I've done learning computer science in my high school years and see the potential in me.</h3>
